### The scheduling layer your GitHub Projects have been missing

GitHub Projects helps you organize work. jayBird Projects helps you schedule it.

When you link issues with blocking relationships, jayBird automatically calculates when each task can realistically start and finish. Set an estimate, add a dependency, close an issue early — dates update instantly across your entire project.

No more spreadsheets. No more manual date juggling. No more "when can we actually ship this?"

### Dependency-aware date calculations

jayBird understands that Task B can't start until Task A is done. When you use GitHub's native "blocked by" relationships, start dates automatically flow from blocker to dependent. Close a blocker early? Every downstream date shifts forward. Running late? The schedule adjusts in real-time.

Your dates finally reflect reality.

### Working calendars that match your team

Not everyone works weekends. jayBird calculates dates in working days, automatically excluding Saturdays and Sundays. Add your company holidays — Christmas, national holidays, team offsites — and watch the schedule adjust.

A 5-day task that starts on Thursday finishes the following Wednesday, not Monday.

### Estimates that make sense

Forget hour estimates that nobody believes. jayBird uses t-shirt sizing (XS, S, M, L, XL) that maps to working days. Add a confidence level (High, Medium, Low) and jayBird adds appropriate buffer time.

Your developers give rough estimates. jayBird turns them into realistic timelines.

---

### Baseline tracking and variance reports

Save a baseline when you commit to a plan. As work progresses, jayBird tracks how the current schedule compares to your original commitment. See at a glance which items are ahead, on track, or slipping.

Answer "are we on schedule?" with data, not gut feeling.

---

### Works with GitHub Projects, not against it

jayBird doesn't replace GitHub Projects — it enhances it. Your issues, your project boards, your workflow. jayBird just adds the scheduling intelligence that's been missing.

Install in seconds. See dates populate in minutes. No migration, no learning curve.
